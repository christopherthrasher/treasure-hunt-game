## Treasure Hunt Adventure Game

A C++ command-line treasure hunt game built using object-oriented programming principles. The game features a grid-based map where a player explores, encounters traps, collects treasures, and competes against an AI-controlled opponent.

## Gameplay Overview
- The game generates a randomized 5×5 board
- The player moves across the board attempting to collect treasures
- Traps negatively impact the player
- An AI opponent moves independently and interacts with the board
- The game ends when all treasures are collected or the player is defeated

## Features
- Object-oriented design with multiple interacting classes
- Player and AI movement logic
- Trap and treasure encounters
- Dynamically generated game board
- Command-line user interface
- Makefile-based build system

## Technologies & Concepts
- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Dynamic memory management
- Header (`.h`) and implementation (`.cpp`) file separation
- Makefile compilation
